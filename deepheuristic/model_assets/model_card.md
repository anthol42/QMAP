# QMAP: Protein sequence aligner
This model encodes protein sequences into embeddings such that their dot product gives the identity between the 
sequences.

It is based on ESM2 35M.

It is included inside the QMAP toolkit package. A python package that allows easier splitting of peptide datasets.

```shell
pip install qmap
```

TODO: Improve the get started guide
```python
from qmap.toolkit import aligner

```
