    "# How to split a dataset\n",
    "The dataset is first clustered, then split along clusters. This means that sequences in the test set will have a low identity compared to the sequences in the training set. The amount of identity tolerated between both set is controlled by the `threshold` parameter. The mechanism works by building a graph where each node is a sequence and an edge is drawn between two nodes if their sequence identity is above the threshold. The leiden algorithm is used to detect communities in the graph. From this, we can extract clusters of sequences. The test set is built by sampling whole clusters. Then, sequences from the train set that share an identity higher than the threshold with the test set can be removed by setting `post_filtering` argument to true."
