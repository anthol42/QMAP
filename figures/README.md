# Miscellaneous figures

This directory contains mutliple notebooks that generates informative figures used in the paper.
- [`max_iden_splits`](max_iden_splits.py): Generate the figure that shows the maximum identity distribution for the 
  homology based split and the random split.
- [`pepatlas2dbaasp`](pepatlas2dbaasp.py): Generate the figure that compares the distribution of maximum identity of 
  the Peptide Atlas database and the DBAASP database.
- [`threshold2pcc`](threshold2pcc.py): Generate the figure that shows the correlation between the maximum identity 
  threshold and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) obtained using a linear model.
- [`Visualize_data_annotations`](Visualize_data_annotations.ipynb): Visualize the correlation between annotations for 
  different strains within the same specie
